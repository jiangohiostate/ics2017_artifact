# ics2017_artifact

The artifact includes most of the programs that are needed to reproduce the evaluation results in our paper "Efficient SIMD and MIMD Parallelization of Hash-based Aggregation by Conflict Mitigation". The programs should be executed on an Intel Xeon Phi SE10P coprocessor with 61 cores. An Intel ICC compiler is required for compiling. Python is also require for executing the scripts that generate some of the inputs. The artifact will print out the execution time of different versions on different inputs to the console and a "results.txt" file.
